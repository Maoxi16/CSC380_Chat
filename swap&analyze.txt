After reviewing the source code, assumptions, and security claims provided by the secure chat program, several potential vulnerabilities 
and areas of concern have been identified that challenge the robustness of their security claims.
First, the lack of transmission encryption in network communications, such as TLS/SSL, poses a significant risk that data can be eavesdropped 
and tampered with despite claims of secure message confidentiality.
Static HMAC salt used in encryption operations may also reduce the effectiveness of encryption protection over time or across multiple sessions.
In addition, the code has potential issues related to buffer management and memory processing, specifically, there may be buffer overflows in file path processing 
and memory leaks in dynamic memory allocation, which can be exploited to harm the overall system and usability.
